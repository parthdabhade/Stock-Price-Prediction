# Stock-Price-Prediction
This project leverages historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2012 to 2025, to forecast future stock prices using an LSTM neural network. The data is first preprocessed by scaling the closing prices with a MinMaxScaler and creating a training set through a sliding window approach with a 60-day lookback. The model itself is built using three LSTM layers combined with dropout to mitigate overfitting, culminating in a dense layer that predicts the next dayâ€™s closing price. The training process, which employs an Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, naturally exhibits slight variability in predictions due to stochastic elements like random weight initialization. Finally, the project includes visualization of the actual versus predicted prices and demonstrates the capability to generate next-day predictions, making it a comprehensive tool for experimenting with stock market forecasting.
